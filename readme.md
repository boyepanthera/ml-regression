# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Q1 Perform the regression analysis using Boston Housing dataset (50 points)

### Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing (25 points)

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform a comprehensive EDA on the Boston Housing
  dataset. Visualize the distribution of the target variable and important features using histograms,
  box plots, and scatter plots.
- Feature Scaling: Discuss the importance of feature scaling in regression analysis.

### Task 2: Regression Analysis (25 points)

- Model Implementation: Using the provided code as a base, implement linear, ridge, lasso, and
  OLS regression models.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate each model's performance using the R^2 score and Mean
  Squared Error (MSE). Discuss the implications of these metrics in the context of model
  selection.
- Report results for simple and multiple linear regression.

## Q2. Perform the regression analysis using Fish dataset (50 points)

### Task 1: Linear regression (25 points)

- Fit a predictive linear regression model to estimate weight of the fish from its length, height,
  and width? (the data source fish.csv is provided).
- Report the coefficients values by using the standard Least Square Estimates.
- What is the standard error of the estimated coefficients, R-squared term.

### Task 2: Ridge and Lasso Regression (25 points)

- Fit the Ridge and Lasso Regression Models
- Report the coefficients for Ridge
